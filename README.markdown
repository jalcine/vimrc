# NeoVim Configuration

![My daily view.](./snapshot.png)

This repository contains the source code for my use of [NeoVim][]. I conventionally use the latest stable release of NeoVim
on my [personal laptop][1]. The configuration is tweaked about bi-monthly with the following concerns in mind:

* *Relevancy*: Plug-ins used should be up-to-date and work together out of the box (or loose coupling)
* *Intuitive*: Using the editor should be more than using your system's plain text editor but a bit less than an IDE.
* *Adaptive*: Load things when you need them and only then.

I keep a list of the plugins I use in the [snapshot file][2] for reproducible installs across machines.
